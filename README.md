# Autocomplete

An autocomplete component. Couldn't get others to work how I want it to, so I made my own.

Prior art:

- [yields/select](http://github.com/yields/select)
- [matthewmueller/autocomplete](https://github.com/matthewmueller/autocomplete)

Some philosophicaly differences:

- Mobile first - so touching outside the menu/input closes the menu. Tap support!
- No blur events - alt-tabbing or clicking outside the viewport won't close the menu
- The menu doesn't close when selected - you have to do it yourself
- Queryless - includes no query structure. You must implement querying yourself!
- Progressive enhancement - doesn't create the `<input>` element dynamically

## Demo

```bash
make
open test/index.html
```

You can also run the tests by:

```bash
npm i -g component-test
make test
```

## API

```jade
.container
  .Autocomplete-menu(.Autocomplete-hidden)
    .Autocomplete-option(.Autocomplete-highlighted)
    .Autocomplete-option(.Autocomplete-highlighted)
    .Autocomplete-option(.Autocomplete-highlighted)
  input[type="text"]
```

Note that `.Autocomplete-menu` has `position: absolute;` by default, so you should have a non-statically positioned parent somewhere.

Also note that this structure is completely optional - you can place the menu wherever you'd like.

### var search = autocomplete(element, [menu])

`element` is the `<input>` element to enhance. `menu` is an optional menu element to use - by default it creates its own and appends it before the input.

### search.query=

You need to set your own query function. Your query function should look something like this:

```js
search.query = function (text) {
  // remove all the options
  search.clear()

  ajax(function (err, options) {
    // do your own error handling
    if (err) return console.error(err.stack);

    // push all the options to the menu
    search.push(options)

    // highlight the first option
    search.highlight(0)
  })
}
```

Each `option` should be an `{}` with an `.id` as well as either a `.title` or a `.name`. Each `option` could also be a string, which will automatically be converted to an object.

### search.format=

Customize the formatting of every option. By default, it is:

```js
search.format = function (option) {
  return '<div>' + (option.name || option.title) + '</div>'
}
```

You may return either an HTML string or a DOM element.

### search.push(options...)

Push options to the menu.

### search.clear()

Remove all the options from the menu.

### search.selected

Selection option, if any.

### Event: change

When an option is selected

### search.highlighted

Currently highlighted option.

### search.hide()

Hide the menu.

### Event: hide

When the menu is hidden

### search.show()

Show the menu.

### Event: show

When the menu is shown

### Event: highlight

When an option is highlighted
